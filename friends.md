### Friends Of ATXSS is an informal business coalition for bars, venues and clubs.


The business coalition is considered informal because the organization does not require membership fees or attendance at meetings.  What ‘Friends Of ATXSS’ represents is a network of like-minded individuals and, businesses working to keep their friends and patrons safe.  Think of it as a powerhouse mailing list of calls to action, political clout and, a living group dedicated to the promotion of responsible drinking. All viewed from a business perspective.

So why have we created the business coalition? The obvious fact is that the business community has a stronger voice with governments than the people do. As a united front, we will have the support to achieve our goals requested of the City. We require those that are willing to assist on their end implement responsible alcohol practices in their establishments.  Furthermore, we may, from time to time, push through fundraising campaigns for both ATXSS Live and our own organization.

And why would you want to join?  This is an organization that brings like minded establishments together; those that serve alcohol and provide entertainment. This allows us to file complaints with the City in a manner that takes the legal pressure off of individual bar owners.  Too many in the industry are all too aware of the legal ramifications of admitting intoxicated people are leaving their establishments. This coalition allows us to lobby on your behalf.  Your logo will be featured on our Friends Of ATXSS site as well.
