ATX Safer Streets is a coalition of concerned citizens advocating a better bus, train, and taxi system in Austin as well as improvements to our overnight parking system. We believe that a better transit structure is the key to reducing drunk drivers on the roads, as well as traffic congestion. We are asking the city to provide:

1. More buses, running later, to more parts of the city.
2. Changes to Cap Metro that will allow the trains to run later on weekends.
3. More taxis, especially on late nights, weekends and special events.
4. Legalization of peer to peer driver programs such as Uber and Lyft as competition for the taxi companies.
5. Reduction or elimination of penalties for people who choose to leave their car downtown overnight to get a sober ride home.
6. More overnight parking downtown with clearer signage in terms of availability and pickup rules.

We do not condone drunk driving; we advocate more choices for people who have been drinking so that they can make responsible decisions.

We believe that people are personally responsible for their actions and should be held accountable for those actions; we also believe that most people will make the right decision when given options. We are advocating more options; we are not advocating abandonment of personal responsibility.

We do not believe our proposal will eliminate the drunk driving problem; we do believe that a better transit system will save lives and improve quality of life for all of Austin.

We believe that improvements to the city's public transit infrastructure are desperately needed in order to maintain Austin's continued growth.  We believe that public transit improvements will help to reduce the workload of APD and EMS and will create a safer city overall.  We also believe that allowing more competition into the transit marketplace is good for the consumer, the city, and private businesses and all will ultimately profit from the changes we're proposing.
