**Your organization seems to encourage irresponsible drinking.** 
Personal responsibility is at the very core of what we are doing. We believe that when given enough options, most people will make the responsible decision. Conversely, our anonymous survey of 651 Austin residents found that most people in Austin who drive while intoxicated do it because they don’t feel that there are very many alternatives. We do not encourage irresponsible behavior; however we acknowledge that the city’s current methods of dealing with this behavior are ineffective, and we are proposing a more proactive solution. 
 
 **Why should my tax dollars pay for drunk people to get home?**
Drunk driving affects everyone, whether you patronize bars/nightclubs or not. The cost of extra police, trials, and investigations is passed on to all taxpayers. No one wants to be in a DWI-related accident; our proposals are focused on getting sober people to leave their cars at home before they start drinking. Additionally, consider the tax dollars of tourists, bar/nightclub/restaurant patrons, and service industry workers. All of these people pay taxes and deserve a safe way to get back to their hotel, to get home, and to get to and from work. 
 
 **I heard that ATX Safer Streets is funded by the rideshare industry.** 
Not true. Our group is a grassroots coalition of concerned volunteers who either currently or have previously worked in the downtown Austin service industry. We are neither affiliated with nor sponsored by any political or corporate entity. Our mission, as stated on our website atxsaferstreets.org, is to advocate expansion and improvement of Austin's downtown transit and parking infrastructure as a means to reduce intoxicated driving. We will continue to report and promote any stories and legal items positively relevant to our goals of easy and convenient 24 hour transportation in Austin TX. 
 
 **Why is your group asking me for money?**
Printing costs are not cheap. In order to effectively spread our message we need to print promotional materials and provide print copies of our proposals to officials and press. Beyond that we are in the process of becoming a non profit and creating a fund to help victims of drunk drivers in our nightlife community. Our mission is to not only improve Austin but help other cities struggling with similar issues in the future. 
 
 **Why are you trying to make cabbies work hours they do not want to work?** 
We recognize that many cabbies are independent contractors and as such, have every right to dictate what hours they want to work. However we can no longer ignore that Austin is now a 24-hour city, and there is an enormous demand for safe rides home at night. If cab drivers do not want to work late nights and/or pick up passengers who have been drinking, then a competing industry - Transportation Network Companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar - should be allowed to pick up the passengers that the taxis aren’t willing to service. 

 **Aren’t TNC’s just unregulated taxis? It seems pretty unfair to taxi drivers, who have to follow regulations.** 
We agree there needs to be regulations regarding TNC’s both for the safety of the driver and passenger. Our proposals suggest using existing TNC regulations in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago as a model for a regulatory structure in Austin. We also believe that the alternative - doing nothing and allowing the taxi shortage to continue - will continue to increase illegal gypsy cabs, who are truly unregulated and are a potential risk for passengers, drivers, and other motorists. 
 
 **So anyone can download a TNC app on their phone and start driving other people around? Isn’t that dangerous?** 
No. You must apply and pass background checks before being hired as a driver. These checks vary depending on the company. Also in place is a two way rating system. Both driver and passenger are required to rate the other, and both driver and passenger will be kicked out of the system if their ratings are too low. However, we recognize that no system is perfect, and just as with taxi companies, some bad apples make it through the cracks. That is why we endorse regulations that will protect both the drivers and customers. 
 
 **What kind of effect will TNC’s have on taxi drivers, pedicabs, and electric cabs? Will TNC’s put these companies out of business?** 
TNC’s are still a very new concept and as of now there isn’t a lot of research on their overall effects on other companies. We don’t believe they will have much impact on pedicabs and electric cabs, who are short-range vehicles. TNC’s operate slightly differently than cabs; cab rides can either be pre-arranged or hailed on demand. TNC rides can only be prearranged through a smartphone app. In a November 2013 interview, the general manager of Yellow Cab L.A. stated that Uber made his company rethink their business model, and is making the taxi companies better. 
 
 **Will increasing public transit really stop people from driving drunk?** 
A 2009 study on public transit in Washington D.C., done by Cornell University (One for the Road: Public Transportation, Alcohol Consumption, and Intoxicated Driving), it was found that for each late night hour bus service was extended: ridership increased by 7%, DWI's decreased 9%, and fatal accidents involving intoxicated drivers were reduced by 70%. We don’t believe it will stop everyone, but we feel it will greatly reduce it, and our anonymous survey backed that up with 94% of our respondents saying they would use public transit if it ran later and in their area.
