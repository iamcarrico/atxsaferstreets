## We need to pressure City officials into change.  Here's how you can help:


<a href="http://bit.ly/1lzKvtE">Please take a moment to take our short, anonymous survey on driving, public transit and drinking in Austin</a>

* Anytime your bus is late, doesn't show, or is too full please tweet @CapMetroATX with time and route.
* Anytime you have trouble with taxi service, tweet @austintexasgov with your complaint.
* If your car gets ticketed excessively or towed, tweet @austintexasgov with your parking location.


Cabbies cannot legally refuse your fare over location, distance, or lack of cash.  If a cabbie has refused you service, took an incorrect route to drive up fare, or done anything inappropriate you can report them <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/online-form/ground-transportation-complaint-form" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please make sure that you write down the cabbie's ID at the time of the incident.
