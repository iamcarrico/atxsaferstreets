## We need to pressure City officials into change.  Here's how you can help:


* Anytime your bus is late, doesn't show, or is too full please tweet *@CapMetroATX* with time and route.
* Anytime you have trouble with taxi service, tweet *@austintexasgov* with your complaint.
* If your car gets ticketed excessively or towed, tweet *@austintexasgov* with your parking location.


### Cabbies cannot legally refuse your fare over location, distance, or lack of cash.  
If a cabbie has refused you service, took an incorrect route to drive up fare, or done anything inappropriate you can report them <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/online-form/ground-transportation-complaint-form" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please make sure that you write down the cabbie's ID at the time of the incident.

### Do you feel like you've been illegally towed? 
Pay your fees and then call 311 to report it.  They will assign a detective to your case.
