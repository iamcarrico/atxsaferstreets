Austin Music Commission on June 2nd at 6:30pm. City Hall.
Urban Transportation Commission (we are still awaiting final confirmation on that and will announce the date then).
If you would like to get involved the public is welcome to speak at the beginning of the meetings and you don't need to sign up prior.

We are also meeting with various businesses and people throughout Austin. We are working hard to get the message out, and we are encouraged by the massive positive responses we have received!
