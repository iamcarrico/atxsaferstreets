#### We've been hard at work on our 2015 Master Plan, which you can view <a href="http://atxsaferstreets.org/pdf/2015MasterPlan.pdf target="_blank">here</a>!

Our platform and campaigns for the upcoming year are laid out here in detail, with additional goals, source material and the many thanks we have for all those who've helped us in the last year.

If you have some additional ideas or projects you would like to see us pursue, please contact <a href="mailto:joseph@atxsaferstreets.org">Joseph</a>.

If you appreciate the hard work we are doing on behalf of Austin's late night community, please consider making a tax deductible donation today!
