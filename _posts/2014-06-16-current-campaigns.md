Good morning Austin!  Here is an updated list of the current campaigns we have running.  Please take a moment to participate and share!

We created a forum on <a href="http://speakupaustin.org/forums/improve-customer-service-and-the-development-and-permitting-process/ideas/we-must-expand-late-night-transportation-options-to-save-lives-taxpayer-money-and-help-create-and-keep-jobs" target"_blank">Speak Up Austin</a>, the City's website for public involvement. The more votes we get, the more likely the City is to discuss it, so please vote and share!
[Cap Metro form letter](http://atxsaferstreets.org/forms/Cap_Metro/Cap_Metro.php).  We are asking for extended hours on several routes.  You can either send the letter as is or change to your liking.
<a href="http://www.gofundme.com/a6yc7s" target="_blank">Fundraiser</a>:  Courtney was involved in a hit & run while biking the other night. This GoFundMe account was set up to help with her hospital bills.
We are collecting personal stories of how impaired driving has affected Austinites. You may email [tumblr@atxsaferstreets.org](mailto:tumblr@atxsaferstreets.org) with your own stories.  Please sign your name in the manner you would like it posted, or you can remain anonymous.
We can always use more volunteers! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TUCnenUqJ_dalLNQ7B_qEevE4umB8Zr0_277jTGvEKs/viewform" target="_blank">Click here</a> to fill out our intake form, and we'll get back to you shortly!
