ATX Safer Streets and Austin Music People have partnered in conjunction with a working group assembled by the Music Commission, to obtain a better understanding of parking challenges that employees of the downtown entertainment industry might face. Together, we have created a survey with questions designed to provide important information that address the needs of those who fuel our nightlife economy.

#### The survey is closed, thank you for your participation! Results will be posted shortly.

We are asking downtown employees to take a few minutes to fill out the survey as well as share it with their friends and co-workers. In addition, volunteers are being assembled to begin door to door canvassing this week. Volunteers will distribute cards with QR codes linked to this survey.

We can always use more volunteers! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TUCnenUqJ_dalLNQ7B_qEevE4umB8Zr0_277jTGvEKs/viewform" target="_blank">Click here</a> to fill out our intake form, and weâ€™ll get back to you shortly!
