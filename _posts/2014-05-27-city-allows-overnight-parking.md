HUGE NEWS!! We asked the City to allow overnight parking on the weekends in the lots under I-35 last week and today we received news they are implementing it starting May 30th! We couldn't have done it without your voices, keep them loud and keep them strong! You can read more details [here](http://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/05-27-14-downtown-austin-insterstate35-i35-parking-lot-hours-towing/).

We've got a lot of big stuff in the works right now, so keep checking back or follow us on facebook and twitter!
