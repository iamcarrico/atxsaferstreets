We have presented our proposal to the City Council (you can view the video [here](http://www.atxsaferstreets.org/media.html)) and will be having a follow up meeting with Councilman Chris Riley on May 6th. We are continuing to meet with business owners and get the word out through social media and flyering of downtown. If you would like to volunteer to be part of the street team or are a business owner that would like to speak with us further, please email us!
